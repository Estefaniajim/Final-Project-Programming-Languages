# Final Project Programming Languages <br/>
Execution program for producer and consumer threads with GUI for inputs/outputs.<br/>
<b>Inputs:</b><br/>
Number of producers (1 - 10).<br/>
Number of consumers (1 - 10).<br/>
Wait time (0 ms to 10,000 ms) for producer/consumer before their next cycle.<br/>
Buffer size (1 - 100).<br/>
Range of values for operations in scheme: [0, 9].<br/>
Operators for scheme operations: +, -, *, /<br/>
<b>Outputs:</b><br/>
To-Do List (Operation and Producer ID).<br/>
Number of tasks to do (amount, percentage, progress bar, etc.)<br/>
List of tasks performed (operation, result and consumer identifier).<br/>
Number of tasks performed (quantity).<br/>
<b>Actuators:</b><br/>
Start button (cleans OUTPUTS, validates INPUTS, creates threads (producers/consumers) and starts execution).<br/>
Stop button (stops/kills the threads).<br/>
