Wait time (0 ms to 10,000 ms) for producer/consumer before their next cycle.
Buffer size (1 - 100).
Range of values for operations in scheme: [0, 9].
Operators for scheme operations: +, -, *, /

Number of tasks to do (amount, percentage, progress bar, etc.)
List of tasks performed (operation, result and consumer identifier).
